# My Portfolio Website

This is a project I've been wanting to do for a while both as a way to build [mavreyn.com](https://mavreyn.com) (my portfolio) and learn how to create a beautifully scratch-made piece for the internet. Right now, the entire project is made using only HTML, CSS, and JS (& jQuery) but I have a feeling that will change in the near future.

The Used Awesome Resources text file contains some of the helpful tutorials I followed along with to incorporate features into my website and I highly recommend watching the videos linked and/or reading the articles. Some tricks are quite clever.

## Things I think are cool

- Animations on the home page are from videos I followed along with
- Using three.js to make some interactive 3D renderings (such as the icosahedron and the bottom wave)
- The home page is all responsive as well

## Wishlist

- Nice article formatting coming up (math rendering, coding block displays...)
