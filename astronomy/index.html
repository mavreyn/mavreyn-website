            What may be the oldest and simplest science may as well be one of the most insightful and romantic. It encapsulates both the expanse of our universe as well as our humble yet special place in space.

            I have always been interested in outer space since I was young. But it wasn't until taking an astronomy course that I began to spend more nights under the stars. I took advantage of the access I had of the night sky and began to learn my way around the stars.

            Today, I am treasurer of the UCF Astronomy Society, proud owner of a Meade ETX-70AT, and a moderately experienced amateur astrophotographer. The starry skies are a place I really enjoy being under, and I hope it brings as much pleasure to you as to me!
