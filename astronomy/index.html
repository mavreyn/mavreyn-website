Astronomy is quite a unique science in that it is one of the few that can be done without much equipment. People have been looking up for thousands of years with just their eyes, and only recently benefitting from the use of modern optics. Even today, amateur astronomy and citizen science still plays an important role in our discovery of cosmic phenomena. In an interesting duality, the simple act of looking up encapsulates botth the expanse of our universe, yet reveals our humble and special place in space.

I have been interested in space for as long as I could remember. I loved watching animated videos on BrainPop about stars, planets, and black holes (which were my favorite) in addition to shows such as Morgan Freeman's Through the Wormhole. And I quite enjoyed taking earth-space science in sixth grade; one of the things I remember most clearly is when we studied and made our own Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. But it wasn't until I took an actual course on astronomy in senior year of high school that I actually started to pick up the hobby.

It was quite bright where I lived (and still is in Orlando) so I focused my efforts on looking at the planets, the brightest of stars (Betelgeuse, Sirius, Arcturus) with a small Celestron Firstscope I borrowed from my cousin. And after switching to a Pixel 4a in the spring of 2021, I started to take pictures using its built-in astrophotography mode.

I came to UCF and joined the UCF Astronomy Society my first semester. Since then, I have become even more knowledgeable on proper telescope operation and care thanks to the many KUTS (Knights Under the Stars) event I helped orchestrate with the team. We have taken a trip to a dark sky location, visited Kennedy Space Center, attended a soft opening of the Seminole State Planetarium's new projector, and so much more.

Today, I am treasurer of the UCF Astronomy Society, and a novice amateur astronomer/astrophotographer with a Meade ETX70-AT. It is my hope that you'll enjoy the night sky as much as I do!
