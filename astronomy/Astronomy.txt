What may be the oldest and simplest science may as well be one of the most insightful and romantic. Looking up, we see both the expanse of our universe as well all the heavenly bodies that surround and mark our special place in space.

I was interested in space from an early age (as most children tend to be). But it wasn't until taking an astronomy course that I began to spend more nights under the stars. And I had a bit of fun giving astrophotography a try.

Today, I am treasurer of the UCF Astronomy Society, proud owner of a Meade ETX-70AT, and a moderately experienced amateur astrophotographer.
